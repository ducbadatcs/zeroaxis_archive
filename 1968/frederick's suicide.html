			On December 14, 1968, Frederick von Aurora, a well-reowned teacher and author, Frederick Aurora had sadly
			passed away. It is suspected that his cause of death was a bullet to his head, from a gun he illegally
			obtained
			from an unknown source. His death was initially faked as a robbery, but eventually revealed to be
			suicide.<br><br>

			In his beneficiary of will, he has left all of the money left to his wife and 3 children, and a letter.

			"
			I can not let those memories of her haunt me anymore. Every day, pain arises as I saw the children in those
			school,
			those enthusiastic dreams and wonders of their young, puppy love, that reminded me of such feelings I had
			back then. The pain of missing Charlotte, damned my heart until this very moment.
