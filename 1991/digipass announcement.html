			Government of Thervota announces digital passport that
			can be doubly used as phone.
		</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
			On 20-May-1991, a new law has passed allowing Thervota citizens
			to accquire a device called the "DigiPass". This device can
			act as a digital passport, as well as supporting messaging and calls.<br><br>
			The device is always set to always update the user's information, in order to avoid
			hassle and time waste when updating information in passport, or create new passports. <br><br>
			The device is allowed to be used in exchange for conventional passport, during Thervota national
			travels, but may not be used on international travels. Several other countries have proposed
			for implementation and support of the DigiPass.
