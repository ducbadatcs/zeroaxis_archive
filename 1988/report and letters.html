		<h3>Demand rises for local technicians</h3>
		<p>
			<em>June 12, 1988</em><br>
			Due to the increase in demand of computers, per ThervotaStats
			this means that local technicians are now in extensive demand,
			as the complexity of computers increases. <br>
			<br>
			Martin Charlotter, support technician of Valencia, has said that
			this increase is hugely benefiting his life,
			as he is now able to spend time taking care of his 3-year-old son,
			and generally having a higher quality of life.
