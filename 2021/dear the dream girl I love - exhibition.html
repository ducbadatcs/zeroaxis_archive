	<h3>1.</h3>
	<p class="dialogue">
		Today, after the boredom of reality, I decided to visit the world of dreams. That girl still happily greeted me
		and even invited me for some candy. Unlike the heavy rains or the burning sun of the real world, the weather
		here was always light sunny with small winds. In the walls of a nearby castle, the clock was pointing at 13:25
		noon. Time reminded me of all this time I have been with her, but I have yet to know her name, Therefore, when
		she was enjoying the view, I came next to her, putting a hand on her shoulder.<br><br>

		"Sorry, but I don't know your name. Young lady of dreams, may I know your name?"<br><br>

		She looked at me, then smiled adorably, before taking a breath and replied:<br><br>

		"My name is Char...Chalot...Charlotte...Lochar....Chartte Aus....Austan..ten....Taustan....tentan...."<br><br>

		When she replied, the sky seemed to have been broken apart into pieces of various colors. The castle was broken,
		then patched back, as if it was a puzzle game. Finally, she seemed to "remember" the answer.<br><br>

		"Phương! My name is Phương."<br><br>

		The skies turned back to the warm sun, and the flowers even swapped places for a new yet familiar scene.
		However, I was the only one witnessing the world nearly falling apart when she tried to say "Charlotte", so I
		only dared to use the second name.<br><br>

		"And you, what's your name? Oh, Đức, I don't even need to ask to know." "This was my dream, so therefore the
		characters should know about me", I thought. She held my hand, and together we began a new adventure. We went
		through a rice field and chased each other as if we were children, until the dark. There were two lovers, and
		now they were making a fire in a seemingly infinite rice field. The sky full of stars, and the faraway mountains
		made as feel even more alone.<br><br>

		And somehow, far away, we saw a street, that looked like the streets of Western countries I saw when I was
		young. Our curiosities pulled us there. All the houses were locked, save for one.<br><br>

		"It's strange, who lets their door open at night like this? Wait, no, there's no one here, why are the other
		houses locked?", I asked her, but she replied with silence. I pushed the door and walked inside. Inside, was a
		family, lying float. They seemed to all have died, and I counted approximately 10 people inside. When I looked
		outside, the sky seemed to break again, and I heard a strange tic tac sound. I looked down at my feet, it was an
		explosive device. When I couldn't react, the dream girl had run there, picked me up, and ran away, and when we
		were out of the street, the house had been in flames.<br><br>

		"Who are those people?", I asked her. "They were the people who brought you sadness, so they deserved that.",
		she replied. But I felt that the answer wasn't right...
	</p>

	<h3>2.</h3>
	<p class="dialogue">
		When she and I were out of that street, what I saw wasn't the rice field we came from, but rather the backstage
		area. A man had been waiting there, and when I hadn't reacted yet he snapped his fingers. The ordinary clothes I
		wore into this dream suddenly became a prestigious vest. Then, without saying a word, he opened the door leading
		to the stage and then pushed me out.<br><br>

		Outside, was a seemingly infinite audience. They spoke in a language I couldn't comprehend. "Phương" was holding
		my hand, and took me to the center where the stage light directly shone down to. A strange woman walked out from
		the first row, her hand holding a necktie headed towards me, and gave it to the dream girl. Within a blink, she
		had already tied it for me. The strange woman walked next to me.<br><br>

		"WELCOME OUR NEW MEMBER!", she announced, not in the strange language, but rather in Vietnamese. The crowd below
		gave me applause, but I heard the familiar sounds of my alarm clock. But I couldn't leave this place.<br><br>

		"Thanks, everyone, I have to leave to go to school.", I told them, but I only received a laugh from them, as if
		what I said was a joke. I ran towards the backstage, but I realized the further I ran, the further it seemed to
		be. By my ears, I could hear the never stopping alarm, but whatever I tried, I couldn't explain to them that I
		needed to return to the real world.<br><br>

		"The Real World? Here we consider it fiction, like if you were reading books or watching movies. They are not
		very useful, and if needed I can create another. And if you want to prove that, then here."<br><br>

		When she finished, I woke up. The clock was pointing at 13:25, I was lying in the school's care room. The nurse
		after numerous attempts seemed quite happy to see me woke up. But when I saw the girl from the dreams, I felt
		chills down my spine. A moment later, she had vanished. I forgot my tiredness and ran up to class to see if I
		missed anything. But unluckily for me, before my eyes was a horrific scene. Students in my class, except for me,
		were stabbed by glass knives, strangely without signs of blood or conflict beforehand. Aren't those deaths what
		I saw at the house back then?<br><br>

		But I didn't have the time to think. The dream girl appeared after me, then laughed maniacally:<br><br>

		"Welcome, to the World of Dreams now as a Frequent Visitor. These things happening were normal, and you will
		soon write a story or game like that."
	</p>

	<h3>3.</h3>
	<p class="dialogue">
		After seeing those scenes, I was truly terrified. The door leading outside slowly opened up, after I went
		outside, what awaited me was an infinitely long hallway, without stairs or windows, far different from my school
		hallways. But I still rushed, because I didn't know where to go. After I ran for a while, the woman holding the
		necktie during the awarding appeared.<br><br>

		"When you're here, there is no exit. Actually, I have one, but do you want to accept it or not.", she
		said.<br><br>

		"What... road...?", I grasped my breath. "Look down." A large hole was opening under my feet. I tried to run,
		but because I was exhausted, combined with the widening hole, I fell down. I looked up, the woman was slowly
		dropping herself slowly, while I was freefalling. Underneath, was a familiar room: the small apartment I used to
		be in when I was small. I didn't know if I was dreaming, or awake.<br><br>

		"Now, very simple. First, go outside, and look at the very cute people you call 'neighbors'. Today, you'll say
		goodbye forever to them."<br><br>

		"Why?", I replied.<br><br>

		"Do you see that notebook on the table?", she said.<br><br>

		I walked near and opened it. The woman told me to write something there, and I wrote "A dog will bring coffee to
		me". Suddenly, there was a dog carrying a plastic bag, inside of which was a refreshing cold cup of
		coffee.<br><br>

		"Good, you understood the rules of the book. Now, I need you to write a story. Good or bad, it doesn't matter.
		But in the end, everyone in this mini complex had to die, somehow. Of course, except you, me, and the An girl
		next door."<br><br>

		"Why?" I asked her, but she only smiled. "Perhaps she knew when I was in kindergarten I would often tell her
		that when I grow up I will marry her, or does she like me and I don't know?", I thought. But wait, the girl of
		dreams, and that An girl... they were identical in looks!<br><br>

		But no matter what, I had to write. In every case, a poor person was chosen. Loud shouts, and puddles of blood,
		slowly became the norm. It was strange that the further I wrote, the more interested I was. Finally, I finished
		the final page. The woman held it up, and satisfaction was clear on her face. Finally, I can walk outside. I met
		that An girl, now a mature girl.<br><br>

		"Hey, you and Phương are the same right? Moreover, what's this all about?" I asked her.<br><br>

		"'Phương' was a puppet, controlled by me. Look at this." she replied.<br><br>

		With only a few actions, An controlled Phương to do everything. From backflipping, balancing on the stair
		handle, or speaking the language I heard during that award. Finally, An created a door, and through it, I saw
		the flower field where I and Phương would often have tea and rest. However, the door vanished in front of my
		eyes, and the familiar scenery around it vanished as well. The scenery turned to a Western-classic street, and
		An held my hand. She took me into a park, and I felt this scene was familiar, but I couldn't tell.<br><br>

		"It was only 91 years, and you already forgot?" she looked at me, then asked innocently.<br><br>

		"91 years? What was that, An? Who remembers things for that long?"<br><br>

		"My idiot. Oh, forgot, I could reach there, you were stuck down there. So I'll simply remind you, of my favorite
		detective fiction author, Frederick von Aurora. I was the girl back then, Charlotte Austanten. I was 13, you
		were 15. It was such a good time back then."<br><br>

		At that time, I felt like another soul merged into me. Frederick's memories, the things he had, the moment he
		held hands with this prestigious girl, and the things he did, all seemed to be imprinted in my mind. And in this
		moment, I looked at the girl in front of me. I now understand everything.
	</p>

	<h3>4.</h3>
	<p class="dialogue">
		Today, was a day like many others.<br><br>

		Even if I woke up from that strange dream, from then, my head kept on repeating what An said. Even though I
		don't need
		to be so worried, because she moved to another country, so-called Thervota with her family when she was small.
		But
		really, was she that beautiful when she grew up? I really wanted to meet her. Even Frederick's tale, because
		ever since
		that day I started remembering things from his past. Over time, I was able to speak French without any
		education, or at
		least gained extra perspectives on things.<br><br>

		One day, I went home. When I opened the door, Mom and some other relatives had opened a party for me.<br><br>

		"Congratulations! You have a scholarship for a university in Thervota. We were proud of you."<br><br>

		"What university?", I asked her.<br><br>

		"Royal University of Thervota."<br><br>

		Suddenly, when I heard that sentence, I felt extremely scared. I hadn't even heard of it, yet I felt like that,
		it must
		have been Frederick. I searched his memories, and it was because he failed this university, and all his sadness,
		from
		Charlotte's disappearance to that failure, made him give up. One night, he ran to the sea and attempted to drown
		himself. But it failed, and eventually, he got onto a local college, and became a teacher until the end of his
		life.
		Could it be that Frederick wanted me to perform his dreams? Nonetheless, it was a really good school, with many
		opportunities and hard entry, so I decided to go.<br><br>

		A few months later<br><br>

		After saying goodbye to my parents, I went on the plane. I felt fine because my family contacted An's, and it
		seemed she
		also got into that school, since the two were close when they were small, An's parents allowed me to stay with
		them.
		According to what they say, They bought a mansion, that's big, comfortable, and not too far away from my school.
		The
		flight seemed to have gone very well, and I was very close to my destination. But suddenly, I heard the voice of
		the
		captain:<br><br>

		"Warning: Our plane is inside an array of signals with an unknown source. Please stay in your place, and
		seatbelts on.
		Please refrain from using your phone or other digital devices, or use in airplane mode. We hope to land safely.
		"<br><br>

		But unluckily, the plane slowly lost direction. It rotated and lost direction before the rudder and fuselage
		went into
		flames. Other passengers were either screaming, some tried to calm others, and the captain and crew were very
		horrified.
		Finally, the entire plane caught fire and crashed onto a mountain.<br><br>

		The next day, I woke up in a hospital bed. Reporters were surrounding me, and according to them, I was the only
		unaffected person after the incident. Some others were injured, had broken arms and legs, and there were even
		deaths. I
		didn't know what to say, so I was silent until they left. A moment later, a doctor went to the bed and gave me a
		piece
		of paper.<br><br>

		"Young boy, luckily you're fine. Now go home, make sure to take rests, and avoid overworking or sports. Your
		family is
		waiting for you."<br><br>

		"Family? What's their name?", I asked him.<br><br>

		"Trần Thu An."<br><br>

		That was An's name, but she was the only one going to take me home. It was the middle of noon on a weekday
		anyway, so I
		thought her parents were at work. I said goodbye to the doctor, then I went outside. Probably because I saw her
		in
		dreams, so she wasn't unfamiliar to me despite us not meeting for so long. After greetings, we went onto a black
		car,
		that had been parked there. The driver introduced himself as Gabriel, the private driver of this family. Until
		now, I'm
		so used to searching Frederick's mind that I don't have to think so hard to browse his memories anymore. Gabriel
		was the
		name of one of his most special students, who was often involved in strange experiments, parts of which had
		become one
		of Frederick's best works. Despite that, me and An said nothing to each other and just looked outside the whole
		trip.<br><br>

		Finally, we went home. I felt something wrong when I reached this mansion. "Oh no, this was the home of the
		killed
		Austanten family". I remembered clearly, that Frederick saw a woman, who looked similar to the one gifting me
		the
		necktie and escorted Lady Charlotte inside. Afterwards, there was a string of shouts, before the two walked out
		happily.
		After that, he and many others rushed in to see the problem and saw all members of the Austanten and Marcen
		families,
		the two noble families, stabbed in the chest by glass knives, without traces of blood or anything else. A while
		later,
		someone reported that the police in the city died the same way. The story spread throughout Harile, the city I'm
		in
		right now, and became a famous urban legend. So An's parents did buy this ghostly apartment and live here this
		entire
		time? However, to ease my tension with An right now, I decided to ask her something.<br><br>

		"An, how are your parents recently?", I asked her.<br><br>

		"You know way better than I do.", she replied.

	<h3>5.</h3>
	<p class="dialogue">
		"You knew very clearly what you did in that dream.", she replied.<br><br>

		I remembered the only thing I did in that dream that somehow involved An's parents was writing a story in
		chapter 3 in
		which her parents were killed. But what does that have to do with reality? Perhaps...<br><br>

		"Oh, I'm mistaken. Let's just go inside.", she said.<br><br>

		She was strange. I didn't know what she meant when she spoke to me, but I hope her parents were fine. Inside,
		the home
		was luxurious. As with the house itself, most of the furniture belonged to the Austanten family since no one
		dared buy
		them. There were a few things that sold for prices up the sky, it made me think that selling them can be enough
		for one
		to just retire and live luxuriously for the rest of their lives. A delicious smell got in my nose, and following
		it, I
		reached the kitchen. A green-colored hair girl was making two pies for me An, and she was rather surprised to
		see me
		arriving earlier than she expected.<br><br>

		"Welcome. I am Claire. I'm this family's housekeeper. Pleased to meet you.", she said.<br><br>

		"Thanks. I am Đức, I'll be here for some time. Thanks for helping my friend's family.", I replied<br><br>

		Was her family rich to the point of being able to hire a local girl for housekeeping? But I felt something
		wasn't right.
		Her green hair doesn't look dyed, but rather very natural.<br><br>

		"You were thinking about my hair, didn't you?", she looked at me and asked seriously.<br><br>

		"I don't.", I replied.<br><br>

		"It's fine, I understand. Everyone who looked at me always asked where this green color came from."<br><br>

		While I was wondering, the two waffles were finished. I returned to the living room, as Claire brought the two
		pies, and
		that was the lunch of two childhood friends. It was 13:25, the sunlight passing through the window revealing the
		Austanten family garden filled with well-cared flowers. After lunch, we decided to hang out somewhere, since it
		was 2
		weeks until our classes. Suddenly, my phone rang, and the caller was my mother.<br><br>

		I picked up the call, and she seemed to be very happy. After sharing the memories and feelings, suddenly she
		said:<br><br>

		"Đức, do you know the story of what happens in the complex we once lived?"<br><br>

		"What happened, Mom?"<br><br>

		"I don't understand why people there just killed each other, now they're all dead."<br><br>

		"What the..."<br><br>

		I could understand if there was a fight or robbery, but simultaneously everyone was just murdering each other
		like that?
		I asked her:<br><br>

		"Do you know the way they murdered each other?"<br><br>

		"Here, let me tell you."<br><br>

		Every word she said, was identical to the story I wrote in that dream. I scaredly looked to the side, to the
		table where
		the book I wrote in that dream lies.<br><br>

		"Why do you sound not fine?", my mom asked.<br><br>

		"Nothing.", I quickly turned off the call.<br><br>

		I was feeling very chaotic. Does it work in the real world? At that moment, An called me. It turns out she still
		loved
		playing catch, so we went to the garden, and in the rush amidst the flowers, An turned back, took a sunflower
		up, and
		gave it to me.<br><br>

		"You still remember once upon a time, when you said you like sunflowers? Here it is for you."<br><br>

		This is clearly not Frederick's words, but mine. After the rush, we were all tired, so we went to An's room to
		take a
		break. Even if there were only one bed and one blanket, An still didn't want me to go sleep in a separate room
		despite
		that would be more comfortable for both. I understood her attention. so finally, I cuddled with her, and the two
		fell
		asleep in this strange place.<br><br>

		****<br><br>

		When I was awake, An was still sleeping. I felt hungry, but I didn't know whether to make my own food or ask
		Claire for
		something. So once again I went to the kitchen, but I saw Claire, two hands with two glass knives, walking
		outside.<br><br>

		"Frederick, you are acquainted with this scene, aren't you?", she asked.<br><br>

		"I'm not Frederick, and I don't know what you hold these two knives for.", I replied.<br><br>

		"Liar. You are Frederick, or at least you have his soul. And don't think I don't know about you both. I know who
		you two
		are."<br><br>

		And just like that, she ran to the door. Despite being a boy, I wasn't able to chase her. Afterward, she opened
		the door
		and hid. A moment later, a car drove in, and two people walked out. I recognized them, they were An's parents,
		so I
		politely greeted them. But while they weren't able to greet me back, Claire passed them as a wind, and within
		moments,
		the two of them became corpses with glass knives stabbed through.<br><br>

		"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING, CLAIRE?", I shouted. My shouting awakened An, as she opened the window and looked
		down.
		Strangely, despite seeing her parents being stabbed like that, there was no reaction from her. However, that
		wasn't the
		scariest...

	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>6.</h3>
	<p class="dialogue">		
		After that scene happened. I didn't know what else to say. I didn't have too many memories with them, so I felt scared and sad more than sad. I looked upwards, An seemed to have closed the window. I intended to go inside. And unfortunately, it led to a much scarier scene. The woman who held the necktie that day, her name was "Marie", calmly walked towards the corpse. Blood was out, and Marie was fascinated. She then added some wine from the dream world, and with that, she had a delicious cup of wine. I ran inside and never dared to look more. <br><br>

On the room, An was crying. I didn't know how to console her, all I could do was to sit down and hug her tight.<br><br>

"I'm sorry, I can't stop Claire. I can not warn your parents, I..."<br><br>

I forgot that the door outside was open, and Marie was walking in. Finally, she made it to this room. <br><br><br><br>

"Lady Charlotte, happy birthday." <br><br>

I hate that face so much already. From made me indirectly kill my neighbors, and now she did those things to An's parents as well. I patted An the her back, before my hand turned into a fist, as I went to Marie. Suddenly, Claire appeared, and at all costs, she prevented me from reaching Marie. But if I can't take care of Marie, I ought to "resolve" Claire, since after all, she was the main source of things. But I severy underestimated Claire's power. She calmly dodged all my attacks, as if she could predict them. On the other hand, every one of her attacks struck, and I had to tank those. I finally stopped, since I knew the more I fight the worse the result. <br><br>

At this moment, Marie opened a hole from thin air. She took out a piece of paper and gave it to An. Afterward, she opened a hole in the ground, then went inside and disappeared. Claire also went outside, leaving the two of us inside. On that night, we were curious, so we took that paper out to read.<br><br>

"<br><br>

Dear Lady Charlotte.<br><br>

According to this contract, you will have great power in the Zeroaxis. However, you must follow a condition: every reincarnation, no matter if the whole soul or part of it reincarnates, the parents of the newborn must die right before its 18th birthday. If you agree, please sign.<br><br>

"<br><br>

In the end, Charlotte signed. So this must have happened, only that An didn't know about it. She told the police, but I think Marie wasn't such a simple person.<br><br>

***<br><br>

At dinner, no matter what she didn't eat what Claire made. I know how to cook, so I decided to go to the kitchen to cook something for her. After a while, I finally was able to make some meat, fish, and vegetables. Of course, I'm not a professional like Claire, although what I made isn't too bad. The two of us didn't want to do anything after dinner, so we went to bed cuddling. And so, the young duo falls asleep again.<br><br>

What was strange was that again, I went to the dream world. I met Phương and asked her to take me to Charlotte's to understand the problem. Finally, I met Lady Charlotte, and she was beautiful, the beauty of eliteness, prestige, and even godly. I walked near her, found the contract in my pocket, and gave her. Charlotte seemed to be quite excited.<br><br>

"I understand. So you want that girl to become less sad?", she asked.<br><br>

"That's one thing, but I don't want her to heal too fast.", I replied.<br><br>

"I'm sorry. But that's something that always happens to me, Frederick, no, 'Đức', I forgot to speak to you."<br><br>

"What do you mean?"<br><br>

"An was one of the carriers of my soul. Exactly in the same way you carry Frederick's soul. Except Frederick was a normal person, and I am a Lady of the Dream World. The girl will lose the memory of that anyway. Now that we mention, look who's coming." <br><br>

I looked to the door, and I saw An walked in. She stared at Charlotte, before disappearing. I suddenly woke up, and I put my hand on her forehead, it was quite hot. Since An had a fever and was asleep, I took a small towel, soaked it in cold water, and put it on her forehead, before going to her parents' room. On the way, I met Claire, and I was going to ask her to take care of An for me, even though she also looked pretty tired.<br><br>

"You are looking at me and thinking: 'I am gonna reveal all the secrets of this house' right? Claire asked. Since I was truly thinking like that. <br><br>

"I'll give you a hint", she said. as she took her birth certificate out. I saw something strange: She was born in 1950, so she should have been a 71-year-old grandma. So why is she so young, and her combat skills so good?<br><br>

"This is the original. You can bring it to the police, they'll test it for you."<br><br>

"So... why are you here, in the first place?"<br><br>

"That's a good question. You're Frederick, therefore you have to go look for the answers yourself."
