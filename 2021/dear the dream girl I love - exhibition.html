	<p class="dialogue">
		Today, after the boredom of reality, I decided to visit the world of dreams.
		That girl was still happily greeted at me, and even invited me for some candy.
		Unlike the heavy rains, or the burning sun of the real world, the weather here was
		always light sunny with small winds. In the walls of a nearby castle, the clock was
		pointing at 13:25 noon. Time reminded me of all this time I have been with her, but I have yet to know her name,
		Therefore, when she was enjoying the view, I came next to her, putting a hand on her shoulder. <br><br>

		"Sorry, but I don't know your name. Young lady of dreams, may I know your name?" <br><br>

		She looked at me, then smiled adorably, before taking a breath and replied: <br><br>

		"My name is Char...Chalot...Charlotte...Lochar....Chartte Aus....Austan..ten....Taustan....tentan...." <br><br>

		When she replied, the sky seemed to have been broken apart into pieces of various colors.
		The castle was broken, then patched back, as if it was a puzzle game. Finally, she seemed to
		"remember" the answer. <br><br>

		"Phương! My name is Phương." <br><br>

		The skies turned back to the warm sun, and the flowers even swapped places for a new yet familiar scene.
		However, I was the only one witnessing the world nearly falling apart when she tried to say "Charlotte",
		so I only dared to use the second name. <br><br>

		"And you, what's your name? Oh, Đức, I don't even need to ask to know."

		"This was my dream, so therefore the characters should know about me", I thought.
		She held my hand, and together we began a new adventure. We went through a rice field, and chased each other as
		if we're children, until the dark.
		There were two lovers, and now they were making a fire in a seemingly infinite rice field. The sky full of
		stars, the faraway mountains made as feel even more alone. <br><br>

		And somehow, faraway, we saw a street, that looked like the streets of Western countries I saw when I was young.
		Our curiosities pulled us there. All the houses were locked, save for one. <br><br>

		"It's strange, who lets their door open at night like this? Wait, no, there's no one here, why are the other
		houses locked?", I asked her, but she replied with silence. I pushed the door and walked inside.

		Inside, was a family, lying float. They seemed to all have died, and I counted approximately 10 people inside.
		When I looked outside, the sky seemed to break again, and I heard a strange tic tacsound. I looked down to my
		feet, it was an explosive device. When I couldn't react, the dream girl had ran there, picked me up and ran
		away, and when we were out of the stret, the house had been in flames. <br><br>

		"Who are those people?", I asked her.

		"They were the people who brought you sadness, so they deserved that.", she replied. But I felt that answer
		wasn't right...

	<p class="dialogue">
		When I and her were out of that street, what I saw wasn't the rice field we came from, but rather the backstage
		area. A man had ben waiting there, and when I haven't reacted yet he snapped his fingers.
		My ordinary clothes I wore into this dream suddenly became a prestigious vest. Then, without saying a word, he
		opened the door leading to the stage, then pushed me out. <br><br>

		Outside, was a seemingly infinite audience. They spoke in a language I couldn't comprehend. "Phương" was holding
		my hand, took me to the center where the stage light directly shone down to. A strange woman walked out from the
		first row, her hand holding a necktie and headed towards me, and gave it to the dream girl.
		Within a blink, she had already tied it for me. The strange woman walked next to me. <br><br>

		"WELCOME OUR NEW MEMBER!", she announced, not by the strange language, but rather in Vietnamese. The crowd below
		gave me an applause, but I heard the familiar sounds of my alarm clock. But I couldn't leave this place.
		<br><br>

		"Thanks everyone, I have to leave to go to school.", I told them, but I only received a laugh from them, as if
		what I said was a joke. I ran towards the backstage, but I realized the further I ran, the further it seemed to
		be. By my ears, I could hear the never stopping alarm, but whatever I tried, I couldn't explain to them that I
		needed to return to the real world. <br><br>

		"The Real World? Here we consider it fiction, like if you were reading books or watching movies.
		<strong>
			They are not very useful, and if needed I can create another.

		</strong> And if you want to prove that, then here." <br><br>

		When she finished, I woke up. The clock was pointing 13:25, I was lying in the school's care room. The nurse
		after numerous attempts seemed quite happy to see me woke up. But when I saw the girl from the dreams, I felt
		chills down my spine. A moment later, she had vanished. I forgot my tiredness and ran up to class to see if I
		missed anything. But unluckily for me, before my eyes were a horrific scene.
		Students of my class, except for me, were stabbed by glass knifes, strangely without signs of blood or conflict
		beforehand. Aren't those deaths what I saw at the house back then? <br><br>

		But I didn't have the time to think. The dream girl appeared after me, then laughed maniacally: <br>

		"Welcome, to the World of Dreams now as a Frequent Visitor. These things happening were normal, and you will
		soon write a story, or game like that."

		After seeing those scenes, I was truly terrified. The door leading outside slowly opened up, after I went
		outside, what awaited me was an infinitely long hallway, without stairs or windows, far different from my school
		hallways. But I still rushed, because I didn't know where to go. After I ran for a while, the woman holding the
		necktie during the awarding appeared. <br><br>

		"When you're here, there is no exit. Actually I have one, but do you want to accept it or not.", she said.
		<br><br>

		"What... road...?", I grasped my breath.

		"Look down."

		A large hole was opening under my feet. I tried to run, but because I was exhausted, combined with the widening
		hole, I fell down. I looked up, the woman was slowly dropping herself slowly, while I was freefalling.
		Underneath, was a familiar room: the small apartment I used to be in when I was small. I didn't know if I were
		dreaming, or awake. <br><br>

		"Now, very simple. First, go outside, look at the very cute people you call 'neighbors'. Today, you'll say
		goodbye forever to them." <br><br>

		"Why?", I replied. <br><br>

		"Do you see that notebook on the table?", she said. <br><br>

		I walked near, and opened it. The woman told me to write something there, and I wrote "a dog will bring coffee
		to me". Suddenly, there was a dog carrying a plastic bag, inside of which was a refreshing cold cup of coffee.
		<br><br>

		"Good, you understood the rules of the book. Now, I need you to write a story. Good or bad, it doesn't matter.
		But at the end, everyone in this mini complex had to die, somehow. Of course, except you, me, and the An girl
		next door." <br><br>

		"Why?" I asked her, but she only smiled. "Perhaps she knew when I was in kindergarten I would often told her
		that when I grow up I will marry her, or does she like me and I don't know?", I thought. But wait, the girl of
		dreams, and that An girl... they were identical in looks! <br><br>

		But no matter what, I had to write. Every case, a poor person was chosen. Loud shouts, puddles of blood, slowly
		became the norm. It was strange that the further I wrote, the more interested I was. Finally, I finished the
		final page. The woman held it up, and satisfaction was clear on her face. Finally, I can walk outside. I met
		that An girl, now a mature girl. <br><br>

		"Hey, you and Phương are the same right? Moreover, what's this all about?" I asked her. <br><br>

		"'Phương' was a puppet, controlled by me. Look at this." she replied. <br><br>

		With only a few actions, An controlled Phương to do everything. From backflipping, balancing on the stair
		handle,
		or speaking the language I heard during that award. But finally, An created a door, and through it I saw the
		flower
		field that I and Phương would often have tea and rest. However, the door vanished in front of my eyes, and the
		familiar scenery around it vanished as well. The scenery turned to a Western-classic streets, and An held my
		hand.
		She took me into a park, and I felt this scene was familiar, but I couldn't tell. <br><br>

		"It was only 91 years, and you already forgot?" she looked at me, then asked innocently. <br><br>

		"91 years? What was that, An? Who remembers things for that long?" <br><br>

		"My idiot. Oh, forgot, I could reach <em>there</em>, you were stuck down there. So I'll simply remind you, my
		favorite detective fiction author, Frederick von Aurora. I was the girl back then, Charlotte Austanten."
		<br><br>

		At that time, I felt like another soul merged into me. Frederick's memories, things he had, the moment he held
		hands with
		this prestigious girl, the things he did, all seemed to be imprinted in my mind. And in this moment, I looked at
		the girl in front of me. I now, have understood everything.
