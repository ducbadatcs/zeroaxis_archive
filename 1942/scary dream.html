	<p><span class="npc">Patient: </span>Hi, I'm recently so tired. I kept dreaming of some strange land.</p>
	<p><span class="louis">Louis: </span>Welcome. Please take a seat. What's your name?</p>
	<p><span class="npc">Patient: </span>
		Daniel Maurice. Neighbor of that missing Charlote girl from 12 years ago.
		Recently she kept on appearing in my dreams.
	</p>
	<p><span class="louis">Louis:</span>
		Are you sure you are not obsessed with that girl in any way? <br>
		What does she look like, a 13-year-old girl or a grown woman?
	</p>
	<p><span class="npc">Daniel: </span>
		No. She's fully grown. She said she was indeed that girl, and I know because I
		was close friends with the Austanten family, and she had the little manners that only they have. My dreams
		usually starts with me and her sitting in an arbor in the middle of a giant garden with all different types of
		flowers everywhere. And I believe I saw that woman "Marie" that the news were talking about as well.
	</p>
	<p><span class="louis">Louis: </span>Why are you so terrified then?</p>
	<p><span class="npc">Daniel: </span>Because in every of those dreams, I always die. If you can name a way to die, I
		endured it in those dreams. I couldn't wake up. I could feel the pain but I couldn't wake up. </p>
	<p><span class="louis">Louis: </span>How long has it been since you had that first dream?</p>
	<p><span class="npc">Daniel: </span>25 days.</p>
