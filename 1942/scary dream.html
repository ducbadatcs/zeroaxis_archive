		<p><span class="npc">Patient: </span>
			Daniel Maurice. Neighbor of that missing Charlote girl from 12 years ago.

			Are you sure you are not obsessed with that girl in any way? <br>
			What does she look like, a 13-year-old girl or a grown woman?
		</p>
		<p><span class="npc">Daniel: </span>
			No. She's fully grown. She said she was indeed that girl, and I know because I
			was close friends with the Austanten family, and she had the little manners that only they have. My dreams
			usually starts with me and her sitting in an arbor in the middle of a giant garden with all different types
			of
			flowers everywhere. And I believe I saw that woman "Marie" that the news were talking about as well.

		<h3>Doctor, patient and priests found murdered, recalling 1930 murders</h3>
		<hr>
		<em>23-March-1942</em>
		<p>
			On 21-March of 1942, signer Daniel Maurice and therapist Louis Toler along with several local
			pastors and priests were found dead, with a knife through their chest. Similar to the 1930s murder,
			there were no blood found in any of the victims.

			<br><br>
			When investing Dr Louis's office, officers found a mysterious note, that match Louis's handwriting,
			that only wrote: "Here lies the canvas". The meaning of the message is unknown, and it's suspected
			that the murderers are the same as the 1930 Austanten and Marcen murders. However, the truths remain
			unknown.
