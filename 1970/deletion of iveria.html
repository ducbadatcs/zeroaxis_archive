	<p class="info">
		On April 10, 1970, the IveriaNews radio station were broadcasting, when suddenly it went into static.
		An inhumane pitched voice similar to that of the 1968 played over their audio.

	<p class="dialogue">
		Welcome. I am Arthur Charlotter. I am the president of Iveria.
		From now on, I declare Iveria not a state, township, village, or location.
		I also declare Iverians not a race, nor people of minority in any country or state,
		that they don't deserve human rights.
		Good night.
