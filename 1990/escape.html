		<h3>Robbery deemed scripted by court</h3>
		<p>
			On April 29, an attempted robbery was reported at
			Mr Martin Charlotter's home at 124 Marie St, Harile. However,
			the act had been decided by the local court as an act.<br>
			Mr Martin had been reportedly bribing his friends so that they would go in his house
			and mess things up, in order to look like he had been attacked / robbed. The
			reason behind this act is unknown. The verdict for this case,
			is Mr Martin has to pay $5000 to the court, and no further charges.
