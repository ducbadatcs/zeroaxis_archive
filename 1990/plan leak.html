		<p><span class="thomas">Thomas: </span>Honey, I found that he was secretly joining a support group there.</p>
		<p><span class="alice">Alice: </span>What support group?</p>
		<p><span class="thomas">Thomas: </span>Remnants of Iveria.</p>
		<p><span class="alice">Alice: </span>Then we have no other choice.</p>
		<p><span class="thomas">Thomas: </span>
			Well, I couldn't do anything.
			We have to make sure we don't violate laws of that country, and we don't want them to find out.
			And plus, they are banning all travels from us.

		<p><span class="alice">Alice: </span>
			Well, that's unfortunate.
			But I have a plan. We'll wait for Vietnam to lift the ban, then we'll go there.
			They can't do anything against us anyway.

		<p><span class="thomas">Thomas: </span>I agree. Honey, would you like some chicken for dinner?</p>
		<p><span class="alice">Alice: </span>Yes, please.</p>
