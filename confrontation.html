		<h3>Single mother found dead in house, police says</h3>
		<p>
			<em>16-July-1990</em><br>
			On 14 July 1990, Carol Charlotter, a single mother living in
			235 Auvert St, were reported to be died of electrocution during
			a phone call with her daughter's kindergarten teacher, Ms Alice
			Charlotter, who reported the incident to authorities.<br>

			The cause of electrocution is believed to be defects in the
			telephone that she used to make the call, and therefore the phone
			is being investigated. The daughter, 5-year-old Liliana Charlotter, reported
			that the incident happened when she tried held her mother's hand. After examination,
			doctors noticed an unusual amount of electricity in Liliana's body,
			equivalent to that of several lightnings,
			but somehow doesn't affect the little girl.<br>

			Currently she's being taken custody for by Alice.
