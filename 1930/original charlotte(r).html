		<h3>Austanten and Marcen family, and police murdered alongside mysterious sighting of Charlotte Austanten</h3>
		<hr>
		<em>14-Sep-1930</em>
		<p>
			On 14-Sep-1930, several witnesses reported that they saw currently-missing
			Charlotte Austanten walking on Blue River St, along with another woman identified as
			"Marie". Witnesses reported that they heard Charlotte and "Marie" spoke to each other, and that one
			keen-eyed
			observer even saw Charlotte's color became bright red. Attempts had been made to pursue Charlotte back to
			her
			family, but all failed.
			<br>
			It is reported later on that the 2 families: The Marcen and Austanten family, were murdered in the afternoon
			of the same day, by the same method: Every victim had a knife piercing through their chest.
			The department of security of Harile also met the same fate, being stabbed in the chest in mid-daylight, and
			the total nuber of victims were 25.
			What's strange about the case, was that despite being stabbed, there were no blood found in
			any of the victim's body.
			There were only one note left at the sight of the incident: "25? Charlotte likes that number! -Marie".
			Currently, police and authorities urge residents to find Marie and Charlotte as fast as possible.
